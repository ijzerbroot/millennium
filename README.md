# Millennium
A keyboard layout

Millennium is a custom keyboard layout that is meant to improve touch typing comfort.
It takes care to avoid the following:
* Commonly used letter combinations under the same finger
* Reusing the same finger in short succession
* Awkward finger stretches in general.

It goes without saying that the base principle is to keep oft-used keys in easy to reach positions, where the most commonly used letters in English are on "home row".
In addition to the above it tries to optimize for "rolls", which can be thought of as pressing neighboring keys in order such as QWERTY's "ER". 

It started from combining a few traits from layouts created by the AKL community.
Inspiration came mainly from the excellent [Maya](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1_a5Nzbkwyk1o0bvTctZrtgsee9jSP-6I0q3A0_9Mzm0/mobilebasic#h.15eb7sf9z9p9) and [Sturdy](https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1_a5Nzbkwyk1o0bvTctZrtgsee9jSP-6I0q3A0_9Mzm0/mobilebasic#h.gmmedttxvbs3) layouts. Kudos to Adi.Lela and Oxey.

Where it mostly differs from the two inspirations is in placing H and M on left pinky, thereby avoiding an NH column or an N-pinky, neither of which I liked very much. 
As both H and M are relatively low-frequency letters in English it feels to me that this is easily handled.

Some letter-combinations that I think work particularly well on Millennium are words like "and", "note", "hold", "under", "test", "get", "starts" but even with M on pinky a word like "must" flows nicely.
Opinions may differ on this but it works for me!

## Word of warning
**Keyboard layouts are quite personal and Millennium makes no ergonomic claims.**
If you are unsure whether trying an alternative keyboard layout such as this might give you Carpal tunnel syndrome or similar negative side-effects, just don't do it. Use at your own risk. 
What works for me may be bad for you and you should certainly expect that any QWERTY-muscle memory that you had will be negatively affected.

The layout proper:

Using angle mod (you type QWERTY C with your left index finger):

Without angle mod (you type QWERTY C with your left middle finger):
